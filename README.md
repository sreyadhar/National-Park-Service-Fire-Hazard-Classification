## Final Project

•	The Fire-Risk Assessment project is developed by the National Park Service's (NPS) Fire and Aviation Management program to respond to the devastating 2011 wildfire season and holds data from 1970-2020. 
•	The dataset can be found at https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/facility. 

•	The aim of the project is to build a predictive model that evaluates certain contributing factors such as access to the facility, the surrounding environments, construction design, and materials and resources available to protect facilities from wildland fire.

•	The data set was procured from:
https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/facility?geometry=50.977%2C-89.991%2C-50.977%2C-89.336 
(last accessed on 10 Oct 2020). An overview of the dataset has been given in table 1.
•	We divided the dataset into nine different tables in the SQL database.
